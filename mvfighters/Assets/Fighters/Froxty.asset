  - "Bro, I don\u2019t get this shit man, like imagine living in a world, quote on
    quote, built around having a strong organized and society, and then you see this
    shitty game I just had bro, LIKE HOOOLY SHIT MAN. I Swear this can't be real.
    I\u2019m either playing with 4 asylum escapee\u2019s or I\u2019m actually matched
    with half-dogs monkeys. Like 1st off I went mid cause I was tired of not being
    able to carry cause of my d0g support pulling me down. But now I had to actually
    deal play against 5 players and deal with my 4 failed a80/7!0n teammates man.
    LIKE BRO YOU SEE ME HAVING 7 KILLS AT 9MIN AND YOU ARE STILL PLAYING LIKE YOU
    ARE GOING TO CARRY. LIKE, YOU AND YOUR SUPPORT IS 3/26 WHAT THE F!@K MAN. I swear
    if you played this game you would've lost faith in humanity man. My jungler is
    out here camping the top laner that is 2/9 like bro, ARE YOU BLIND DO YOU NOT
    SEE ME OR YOU\u2019RE JUST GENUINLY R3t@/-3D TURBOC@#/3R R37@/-3D? I swear people
    play this game like it\u2019s a speed run or some sh!t, they just keep using
    the same strategy without using a single of their 21 chromosomes, they would
    rather use their 1 of their deformed b-@1n tumor c@#-3r to play the game out
    man. I\u2019m exhausted of this shit, the only reason we won that game is because
    I somehow stole baron with my Q and they didn\u2019t back while I was backdooring
    HAHAHAHHAAHAH. ON GOD MY TEAMMATES DIDN\u2019T SERVE TO GET A SINGLE LP. ALL
    OF THEM HAD A KDA OF 0.15 AND LESS IF YOU ONLY COUNT THEIR KILL/DEATH. Ah I man
    I can\u2019t speak anymore I\u2019m too tired for this sh!t man some of them
    straight up deserves to get a ticket to h311 already zzz."
